      <![CDATA[<p><strong></strong>Easter is fast approaching and these bags are just too cute not to make.</p>
<p>This blog is a step by step instruction on how to sublimate these beauties.</p>
<p>(Psst, if you are more visual you can check out the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpOtzap2sis">here</a>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polyester SUBLIMATION bunny bags (can be purchased from Design Blanks <a href="https://bit.ly/2SjjrF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
<li>9x9 pressing pillow <span>(can be purchased </span><span></span><a href="https://bit.ly/2RTjmJh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><span>)</span>
</li>
<li>Tracing/sketching paper</li>
<li>Measuring tape</li>
<li>Sublimation image (make sure it is mirrored!!)</li>
<li>Scissors (these are optional)</li>
<li>Heat tape (again optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid1_large.PNG?v=1580755801" alt=""></p>
<p>1. Measure your bag to the size of image you want and print your image (we recommended 6.5 x 3.5 inches for the face however if image says HAPPY EASTER or something that doesn’t need to be centered you can make it bigger)</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid2_large.PNG?v=1580755831" alt=""></p>
<p>2. Insert pressing pillow in the bunny bag. <span>Make sure that when it inserted the area where the image will be is not obstructed by anything inside the bag. Ex: make sure the strap is BEHIND the pressing pillow. If not your image risks having lumps or curves in it.</span></p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid3_large.PNG?v=1580755843" alt=""></p>
<p>3. Place your image on your bag and make sure it is lined up where you want the image to appear on the bag. I find this is easiest to do if image is cut around.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid4_large.PNG?v=1580755866" alt=""></p>
<p>4. You can now use heat tape to secure the image (this is optional)</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid5_large.PNG?v=1580755886" alt=""></p>
<p>Now is time to press!!</p>
<p>5. Bring your bunny bag into your heat press that is set to 200C for 45 Seconds.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid6_large.PNG?v=1580755899" alt=""></p>
<p>6 . Place tracing paper over the bunny bag to protect from the heat press.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid7_large.PNG?v=1580755943" alt="">7. Press with medium pressure</p>
<p>**Be careful when pulling everything out of the heat press it is VERY hot**</p>
<p>8. Peel/pull off paper (you can now toss the paper out)</p>
<p>9. VOILA! Finished bunny bag with a cute face!</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid8_large.PNG?v=1580755823" alt=""></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>This month we showcase Country Chic Fancy Frock. </p>
<p>Fancy Frock is a light, icy blue color that goes so beautifully with springtime florals<span> </span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🌸</span></span><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">🌼</span></span></p>
<p><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">I really love this colour so I used it on 2 different projects this month. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">First I took home a damaged panel sign. It had a visible indentation. A quick coat of paint, then I filled in the dent by mixing a small amount of Fancy Frock with Country Chic texture powder. It only took one swipe of my mixture. It dried very quickly and with a light sanding, it was almost invisible. Keep this in mind because it's a great way to fill in furniture imperfections that you might come across. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">Next, I did a light sanding to smooth out any brush strokes. This paint goes on like butter but in this case, I cut corners and used a teeny 1" foam brush. This required me to go over the surface too many times. Completely avoidable had I not been in a hurry and used the right tools for the job. I used a light application of natural wax. I always use a light coating of wax on my signs. A quick application followed by a light buffing to remove any excess. It ensures that your stencil won't lift any paint when repositioning or removing. I also feel it helps prevent bleed.  followed by my sign stencil. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/pt1_grande.jpg?v=1588804487" alt=""></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/pt2_grande.jpg?v=1588804494" alt=""></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/pt3_grande.jpg?v=1588804502" alt=""></p>
<p>I chalked that up as a success and moved on to a bigger project. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/FancyFrockMay_grande.jpg?v=1588803174" style="float: none;"></p>
<p>I love the shape of this old dining chair but I didn't love the old scratched and worn finish. I gave it a light sanding with one of our <a href="https://www.designblanks.ca/collections/new-back-in-stock/products/sanding-block" target="_blank" style="background-color: #eeeeee;" rel="noopener noreferrer">small sanding blocks</a> and applied the Country Chic Fancy Frock with the <a href="https://www.designblanks.ca/collections/country-chic-paint/products/country-chic" target="_blank" style="background-color: #eeeeee;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Chic painting sponges</a>. They are really great at getting in and around the spindles and odd shapes. I was impressed with how quickly I could get a coat on using the sponge. This was 2 coats and I couldn't wait to take my after picture! I will go back and do a few touch-ups but I don't know if another full coat will be necessary. Mt next step will be to finish with a protective coat of wax. I just can't decide between the natural wax and the white wax. Decisions, decisions. </p>
<p>Both of these projects were completed using a 4oz size of Fancy Frock. I don't expect to have any left after the final touch-ups. <a href="https://www.designblanks.ca/collections/country-chic-paint/products/country-chic-fancy-frock" target="_blank" style="background-color: #eeeeee;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get your own 4oz Fancy Frock</a> for 20%off while it's the colour of the month (May 2020) Only $7.96</p>

<p>This is a perfect season to flex your original design ideas. After the rush of Christmas, you might find that you have a nice lull in your orders. Take some time to get back to your original ideas and designs and reconnect with your love of crafting.  </p>
<p>I took some me time today and put this together. I love it! <span>Cute, trendy and practical.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/20181229_134851_medium.jpg?v=1546110114" style="float: none;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/20181229_134840_1_medium.jpg?v=1546110136" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel like this is the perfect spring bag for any sophisticated pre-teen to adult. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your customers will love and appreciate your original ideas. People will borrow them eventually but imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. <span>You are welcome to use any of our ideas. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I used one of our platinum glitter bottom, cotton canvas totes. A Geo bunny design from The Hungry Jpeg (pop into our forum and the lovely Marie will hook you up with her link). I added a faux fur bunny puff pom-pom.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel excited and inspired. It's a relief after a very hectic holiday season to feel like I'm getting my groove back. So, now I'm working on a second 'out of the box' idea. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>How to:</p>
<p>1. Measure your bag to the size of image you want and print your image (we recommended 7 x 2.5 inches for writing on the thigh of a 2XL, depending on placement area the size will be different.)</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid_num_1_large.PNG?v=1580834528" alt=""></p>
<p>2. Cut image out of the paper, this makes it easier to place and align.</p>
<p><em><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid_num_2_large.PNG?v=1580834583" alt=""></em></p>
<p><em>3. </em>Insert pressing pillow inside the pant leg, make sure to add a piece of sketching paper INSIDE the pants ABOVE the pillow to prevent any ink transfer to the other side of the pant leg.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid_num_3_large.PNG?v=1580834641" alt=""></p>
<p>4. Place image on pant leg and tape using heat tape (this step is optional)</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid_num_4_large.PNG?v=1580834665" alt=""></p>
<p>5. Put boxer shorts in the heat press (make sure to check the image is still in the right place and elastic is on the outside of the heat press to not shrink or melt the elastic), cover with a sheet of sketching paper.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/vid_num_5_large.PNG?v=1580834703" alt=""></p>
<p>6. Press with medium pressure at 200 C for 45 seconds.</p>
<p>**Be careful when pulling everything out of the heat press it is VERY hot**</p>
<p>7. Peel/pull off paper (you can now toss the paper out)</p>
<p>8. All done!! Check out your new boxers!</p>

    <title>For your Special Valentine ♥</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>Do you advertise Valentine's Day items in your business? Many people decide to sit this one out. They may still be recovering after the rush of the hectic Christmas holiday season (we don't blame them!). Here at Design Blanks, we find that fewer people offer Valentine's Day items but the ones that do offer it can do very well. </p>
<p>Consider smaller scale gift items. Perhaps a cute makeup bag personalized with a name and a sweet candy or chocolate treat inside. A glitter bottom reusable shopping tote or build rustic tic tac toe kits. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/PicMonkey_Collage_large.jpg?v=1579118669" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>You might find cute red or pink toques are a nice item for quick sales. These are nice in that they don't require any personalization. February 14th is still plenty cold across Canada for a pom-pom toque, a messy bun style toque or the adorable double pom-pom bobble beanie for children. </p>
<p>Buffalo plaid shirts or tunics in the colours of love. I like the tunics as is but the buffalo plaid raglans have a great body space for customization. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/PicMonkey_Collage2_large.jpg?v=1579119381" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Everyone loves pajamas! Many of our styles make perfect Valentine gifts. With these cute new mock-up images, you can add your own mocked up graphics to advertise. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/PicMonkey_Collage3_large.jpg?v=1579120840" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Or maybe just a small heartfelt token. A heart-shaped keychain to remind someone you love them as they go about their travels or a stunning little heart barrette. These small items make a big impact when gifted with a thoughtful card to a special someone. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/PicMonkey_Collage4_medium.jpg?v=1579122796" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Whatever you choose to do this Valentine's Day, Design Blanks hope that you do it with a little extra creativity and a little extra love ♥</p>

    <title>Whats New for 2020!</title>
    <author>
      <name>Deb Summers</name>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>A new year is so exciting! What will this year bring? It's also a great time to take a look at your business and make a few changes.</p>
<p>This is one reason that I love taking a long Christmas break from my business. A stretch of days spent cozy at home with my family and pets. It also allows me time to reflect on the last year of business. What did we do really well this year? What do we need to improve? How do we go about that? </p>
<p>Let me introduce a few new changes we have heading into 2020. </p>
<p>We have a new Contact Us form on the website. This is a really great one. Normally, we would ask people to message us on the facebook page as our first choice but Facebook messenger is a flawed platform. With multiple people answering messages, it doesn't provide a good filing or cataloging system and sometimes if the person answering didn't know the answer, that message would have to wait until I could get to it but in the meantime, it runs the risk of being buried. Buried very deeply. Our second choice was email but our inbox has had up to 100 new emails in a day from companies, suppliers, and customers. It gets very messy. </p>
<p>Introducing our new <strong>Contact Us Form! </strong>Find it at the bottom of the website. If you send us a message through the contact form it will direct it to a very specific region in our email and we have a filing system set up there. People have been using it over the holidays and it is working beautifully! This is now our first choice for contacting us. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screenshot_9_large.png?v=1578361351" alt=""></p>
<p>You might also notice our new <strong>Return Centre</strong>. Use this if you need to report receiving an incorrect item an item with substantial damage. Please make sure you are familiar with our return policy first. </p>
<p>Last but not least. We are excited to announce our <strong>bulk pricing options</strong>. You have been asking and we will work hard at getting these new pricing grids up on our listings. </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screenshot_12_large.png?v=1578361905" alt=""></p>
<p>This feels like a fabulous start to a new year. 2020 promises to be amazing. </p>
<p>Watch for new 2020 product announcements coming soon!</p>]]>

    <title>Wooden Blanket Ladder</title>
    <author>
      <name>Cora Ethier-Ryan</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>Us crafters tend to dip into several type of crafts and not just stick to one and if you are anything like me you have tons of crochet/knitted blanket hanging around your house. What better way to store them then on display... so I decided to make a Wooden Blanket Ladder and figured I would share with my fellow crafters.</p>
<p>Here is what you will need:</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<ul>
<li>(1) 14′ long 2×4 or you can use 2 pieces that are 8′ long 2x4s</li>
<li>(1) 6′ long 2×3 </li>
<li>Wood Screws -  I use 2 per side per each bar across for a total of 16.. make sure to have a few extras just in case. I used 3 inch wood screws. </li>
<li>Wood stain or paint – I used </li>
<li>Sander - you can do this by hand if need be, just goes faster with the sander.</li>
<li>Saw - this may not be necessary if you can get the people at Home Depot to cut them for you.</li>
<li>Power drill </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>Cut pieces to length</p>
<ul>
<li>cut your 8' long 2x4 pieces to 6.5' (or keep them at 8 feet depending on long you want the ladder to be, if you keep it at 8' I would add an extra middle piece)</li>
<li>cut your 2x3 into (4) 1.5' pieces</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 2: </p>
<p>Sand down all your pieces, make sure there is no little pieces sticking out, they will get stuck in your blankets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 3: </p>
<p>At this step you can either start putting it together OR you can stain it first. <br>I stained mine first to make sure all nooks are filled with stain. Keep extra stain to patch any small parts that need touched up once put together.</p>
<p>I did 2 coats on each side of the wood. I left it to dry overnight between coats.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-08_at_8.45.47_PM_large.png?v=1520560055" alt="" width="129" height="180"> </p>
<p>Step 4: </p>
<p>Lay the pieces out (the diagram below will show you the spacing I followed from an online image), you can change the layout based on what you will be putting on it or to make it aesthetically pleasing to you. </p>
<p><a href="https://sydneymakesstuff.wordpress.com/2016/02/13/diy-quilt-ladder/"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/quilt-ladder-measurements_post_large.jpg?v=1520559732" alt="" width="145" height="203"></a></p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<p>Screw everything together, I made the pieces parallel to the floor but you can put them on an angle if you prefer. Try hanging your blanket on the cross bar in your hands to see how you want to angle it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 6: (optional)</p>
<p>Angle the legs, this can be done by turning your mitre saw to the right angle. This step will differ depending how far away from the wall you decide to put your ladder. In this step you could also angle the top of the ladder to have it sit flush with the wall. this makes the ladder more stable.</p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/28832936_1102285429911598_1249907927_n_large.jpg?v=1520560095" alt="side angle of a blanket ladder" width="157" height="210"></p>
<p>Step 7: </p>
<p>Hang your blankets and be very proud of yourself. This ladder will be an excellent conversation starter and a perfect way to showcase the lovely blankets you have laying around the house. </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Did you catch the first 'Thinking outside the box' post? This was the second project that I created that same day.</p>
<p>For this project, I used what is traditionally referred to as our beach bag but it's an all around great bag. Not just for the beach! It is deep and lined inside. <span>Our leading moderator Marie hooked me up with a link to the perfect bunny </span>svg<span>. </span>I used my favourite Siser white StripFlock. I wanted the look of a nice thick vinyl and I love the fuzzy Siser StripFlock. I almost went with a Siser White glitter HTV but I knew that I wanted a pom-pom tail so I had to pull myself back a little and remind myself that sometimes less is more!</p>
<p>Next decision, what colour pom-pom tail?</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/20190110_200502_1_compact.jpg?v=1548803299" alt="">     white or pink?      <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/20190110_200512_1_compact.jpg?v=1548803315" alt=""></p>
<p>I thought for sure that I was going to prefer pink but that day I was feeling the white. The pom-pom is just one of our pom-pom keychains with the hardware removed and sewn on with a simple stitch. </p>

<p>Super cute!! Go exercise your creativity.... hop to it :) </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Adorable, amazing quality and great sellers. </p>
<p>Bunnies have hopped back to our shelves. These are great quality with weighted bottoms so they sit up nicely. Available in 10" or 16" sizes.</p>
<p>HTV the ears or add a wine bag to add a special message or name on one of our wine bags. We have faux jute wine bags for our htv crafters or polyester wine bags for our sublimation printers. </p>

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Colouring used to be something only kids did but adults are now joining in on the fun!</p>
<p>You can colour pretty much anything now so why not create your own Cushion Cover to colour with permanent/fabric markers.</p>
<p>This makes such a cute gift for anyone really!</p>
<p>Depending what you decide to put on the cover it can be as simple or as complex as you desire.</p>
<p>These cushion covers make a great conversation piece. </p>
<p>Things you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cushion cover</li>
<li>Heat Transfer Vinyl (colour of your choice)</li>
<li>A cutting machine (you can always cut by hand but it might get tricky)</li>
<li>The image (outline ONLY) you want to put on the cover</li>
<li>A heat press (or the Cricut Easy Press or a home iron)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 1 :</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload your image into the program you use to cut (In this case I am using Cricut Design Space)</li>
<li>Make sure your image does not have a background, if it does remove it with the cleaning tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure your cushion cover and decide how big you want the image to be (you can add several images or just one it is up to you)</li>
<li>Enlarge your image in your cutting program to the size you desire</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place vinyl on cutting mat and load into machine</li>
<li>Cut the image and weed (this is usually the fun part!)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="unicorn HTV transfer" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31749588_1134595623347245_5379476796284600320_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796309" style="float: none;">         <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31766447_1134595660013908_8059120545960034304_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796301" alt="Stars and TESSA cut out in vinyl"></p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre heat Cushion Cover for 3-10 seconds (depending on your heating device: 3 for a heat press, 5-10 for easypress and iron since they don’t have the same amount of heat)</li>
<li>**** If pressing with the Cricut Easy Press or a home iron, Iron on in sections for best adherence</li>
</ul>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31755394_1134595676680573_4890975170316992512_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796304" alt="heat press"></p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply vinyl to cover</li>
<li>Cover with Teflon Sheet (or parchment paper)</li>
<li>Press the image into the Cushion cover</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31841838_1134595583347249_3287810959875244032_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796290" alt="vinyl on cover ready to press">              <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31769540_1134595666680574_5380069252663345152_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796311" alt="teflon sheet covered image"></p>
<p>Step 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>After pressing remove Teflon Sheet</li>
<li>Remove carrier sheet and repress with Teflon sheet for another few seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31755306_1134595630013911_4664962764156960768_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796306" alt="unicorn image on cushion cover">                   <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/31755394_1134595676680573_4890975170316992512_n_medium.jpg?v=1525796304" alt=""></p>

    <title>Inventory vs. Running Open Sales</title>

      <![CDATA[Check out these 2 methods of selling... which one is better for your business?<p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.designblanks.ca/blogs/news/inventory-vs-running-open-sales">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>Every business operates differently but one thing we seem to have found in crafting businesses there are 2 different styles that seem prominent. All with their pros and cons of course. We wanted to share with you the 2 different styles we have seen in case you are starting off or find that your method is not really working and you are not quite sure where to go from where you are now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Inventory Method </p>
<p>This method requires some capital investment, as you will need to purchase some inventory to always have on hand stock for things you are selling.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can always provide things to your client in a short period of time.</li>
<li>Always have on hand the products you’ve done in the past</li>
<li>Be sure that what your clients requests are product you can provide</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a big investment to make sure you always have stock</li>
<li>Takes a lot of room to carry all the items and keep up with inventory</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Running Open Sales Method</p>
<p>This method requires your business to focus on a few items at a time and run an open sale for items meaning that you create a few mock ups or post images of the product and you choose how long you will host the sale period. Then once you decide its over (usually based on inventory stock from your supplier OR a holiday is getting close) you place your order with the supplier and get ONLY products people have paid for already.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have no inventory which means it does take up space or money</li>
<li>Your clients are always being offered a few products at a time making it less overwhelming for them in terms of options</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may take a little longer for clients to get their items from you</li>
<li>If someone wants an item after the sell period you wont have it available to them</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall both methods work depending on your market and the type of customers you have. </p>
<p>A mix of both methods can be used as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>You could carry inventory and run sales on very popular items for specific holidays (ex: bunny baskets, ornaments)</li>
<li>You could run sales of specific items and then have a few extras in stock for those who answer after the sale period is over</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to find a method that works for you business and move forward based on YOUR client base. Even if someone is in the same area does not mean they target the same people.</p>
<p>Be sure to know YOUR clients.</p>]]>

    <title>Cricut tools… Which are my fav?</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[Learn about Cora's favourite Cricut tools!<p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.designblanks.ca/blogs/news/cricut-tools-which-are-my-fav">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>For those of you also using a Cricut (sorry silhouette users) or are thinking of buying one</p>
<p>I have a list of my favourite must have tools that work fantastic with the machine.<br> Now I have the explore air, so some of these tools may not work with your machine (like if you are using the Maker for example) but they generally have a Maker equivalent, I will post both links under the pictures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Scoring tool</strong></p>
<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_8.42.44_AM_compact.png?v=1521464571" alt="Cricut scoring tool"></p>
<p>This tool changed my life. I used to try to make envelopes and cards and fold them myself and would always end up with crooked lines. This thing creates an indent in your cardstock to make it super easy to fold. No cut line, no marked line just an indent so you know where to fold.</p>
<p>This works with both the air and Maker machines.</p>

<p><strong>Fine Point pens</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_8.47.02_AM_compact.png?v=1521464577" alt="Cricut Black Pens"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_8.47.09_AM_compact.png?v=1521464582" alt="Cricut colourful pens"></strong></p>
<p>These are great for writing your own invitations, care cards or just Christmas cards. You just have to insert them in the pen attachment and make sure to select a writing font and voila beautiful writing! I suggest having a pack of coloured pens (for when you are feeling funky and colourful) and a set of black.

<p>You should always have several mats in your stock especially if you are working with cardstock. I find with vinyl the mats don’t get used up as much but with cardstock they definitely do! There are 3 different mats, mostly I recommend the green it does the generic stuff. Blue is for light grip which means things that are dainty like washi tape. And the Purple I use to engrave or hold my leather it is a strong grip. DO NOT USE THE PURPLE FOR CARDSTOCK it will not come off easily and will ruin your project.</p>
<p>12x24inch mats are great for long projects you don’t want to slice up, like ceramic tiles.</p>
<p>These mats can be used with both the explore air and Maker machines. </p>

<p><strong>THE MAKER</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-19_at_8.59.12_AM_compact.png?v=1521464597" alt="Cricut Maker"></strong></p>
<p>Now, I have not used this machine yet but I hear nothing but great things about it. If you are interested in purchasing it I will include the link at the end. The best point I hear about this machine is how it cuts fabric so easily. The explore air and air 2 do as well but it sounds like it is more of a hastle since it needs the stabalize, and with the Maker is does not. I will be purchasing the Maker shortly so stay tunes for those blogs. </p>
<p>I have included a link here for all the tools that are for the MAKER ONLY! The blades are a bit different and there is fabric makers and other smaller accessories that work great with the Maker. </p>

<p>Tweezers to weed the vinyl BUT not just any tweezers, this is the 6<sup>th</sup> pair of different tweezers I try and have stuck with them. These are fantastic; they are perfect for weeding big or small items. Very easy to use and comfortable in my hands, I should mention my hands are not very big so some of the tools I disliked just didn’t fit right in my hands.</p>
<p>I bought these tweezers from a craft fair over 3 years ago and they are still lasting just as long. I told Deb to get them in stock because people would love them. So you can actually get them right here on designblanks.ca here is the link to them directly for you!</p>

<p>This thing is magical when paired with the tweezers! You put it on your hand (like a ring) and you put all the little pieces you weed in there instead of sticking them to you. To empty it simple move the flaps and ta-da all clean.</p>
<p>This has been a lifesaver.</p>

<p>These things are perfect when working with cardstock. The spatula makes lifting what you cut a breeze. It doesn’t manage or bend your design. Perfect for anything you cut that is small.</p>
<p>The scrapper is great for lifting the leftovers from your cardstock or vinyl that got stuck to your mat. I also use it to lift bigger items</p>

<p><strong><em>Pressing Pillows</em></strong></p>

<p>For those of you using Iron-On or HTV vinyl I would highly recommend using pressing pillows.</p>
<p>They are great for absorbing seams (when making tshirts and onesies) to get an even press.</p>
<p>Whether you are using a home iron, the cricut easy press or a heat press they would very well. Makes it easier to press your items without having to worry about the seams.</p>
<p>You can get them here at designblanks.ca</p>

    <title>Thinking of buying a heat press... Here is some info</title>

      <![CDATA[Information about heat presses ... Clamshell or Swing Arm which one is right for you?<p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.designblanks.ca/blogs/news/thinking-of-buying-a-heat-press-here-is-some-info">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>

      <![CDATA[<h1><strong>Clamshell Heat Press </strong></h1>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-12_at_11.54.02_AM_large.png?v=1520870445" alt="Clam shell heat press" width="228" height="234"></strong></p>
<p>A Clamshell press gets its name from its motion.</p>
<p>It opens upwards like a clam and when shut it clamps down to ensure pressure on your item.</p>
<p>Their design varies compared to the other models. The press has a hinge in between the lower and upper platens, which enables it open or close like a clamshell. The hinge has a pressure knob that is easily adjustable to change the needed pressure on items. </p>
<p>This can be used for multiple items that have a flat surface (ex: shirts, onesies, towels, blankets…)</p>
<p>This press is manual and requires someone to open and close the lid for every press. It comes in a variety of styles and sizes.</p>
<p>This press falls under the more affordable presses on the market.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>Swing Arm Heat Press</strong></h1>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-12_at_11.54.25_AM_large.png?v=1520870440" alt="Swing arm heat press" width="212" height="213"></p>
<p>This press gets it’s name from the motion the press does once it is fully open.</p>
<p>The top platen swings away from the lower one. This adds benefit when pressing as you can place your items a bit easier and see the design from the top perspective.</p>
<p>These presses often have a 5 in 1 function which allows you to purchase additional accessories separately, like the mug press or hat press) without having to purchase another press.</p>
<p>These presses are built for home and commercial uses.</p>
<p><br> If you purchase this press ensure that you have plenty of room and use a surface that is not glass. The heat radiating from the press may cause a glass table to crack.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>*** Both of these are good for pressing items such as cushion covers, tshirts, onesies, tea towels, bags etc... </p>
<p>A good tip is to use a teflon sheet over your item between the plate of the heatpress and to also use a pressing pillow (they help absorb seams, zippers etc...)

<p>It is important to know what vinyl to use for each project. Find advice here. </p><p><a class="read-more" href="https://www.designblanks.ca/blogs/news/different-types-of-vinyl">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>For this blog post I decided to use the most commonly used brands of vinyl.</p>
<p>There is vinyl to use for mugs, canvases, bowls, water bottles, walls and basically any other ideas you may have that are not material (i.e. a shirt)</p>
<p>It is important to know what to use, to make sure that you are not damaging items or having vinyl peel off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Oracle 631 and Cricut vinyl</strong></p>
<p>These two types of vinyl function the saw way, they are both non-permanent. They are ideal for temporary of short-term decals.</p>
<p>They can be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wall art</li>
<li>A stencil when making a wood sign</li>
<li>Removable decals</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Window decors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Cricut Premium Outdoor Vinyl</strong></p>
<p>This vinyl is used for the same things as the regular vinyl and the Oracle 631 however, it is a little bit tougher so it withstands more wear and tear but is not permanent.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Oracle 651 </strong></p>
<p>This vinyl can be hand washed and cleaned and used repeatedly with no tearing or peeling.</p>
<p>They can be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mugs</li>
<li>Water bottles</li>
<li>Canvases</li>
<li>Ornaments</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Oracle 813</strong></p>
<p>This is a transparent blue PVC film that is used for stencil application especially with spray paint and brush painting. It is not very sticky which makes it perfect to apply, paint then remove and get crisp lines.</p>
<p>It is recommended to have a smooth, flat surface when applying for best result.</p>
<p>It can be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood signs</li>
<li>Wall stencils</li>
<li>Any other stencils</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cricut Iron-On</strong></p>
<p>This vinyl is used for material items and uses a heat press, a home iron or an easy press to apply it. This vinyl requires a big amount of heat in order to adhere properly to the products.</p>
<p>It can be found in several categories for different types of materials and looks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holographic</li>
<li>Glitter</li>
<li>Foil</li>
<li>Printable </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Siser </strong></p>
<p>Is a brand of vinyl that specialized in Heat Transfer Vinyl. This is the same concept as the Cricut Iron-On but has a few added categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Easyweed</li>
<li>Easyweed Stretch</li>
<li>Glitter</li>
<li>Stripflock</li>
<li>Holographic</li>
<li>Metallic</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In the Siser brand Easyweed vinyl is used for a different purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Easyweed</strong> is recommended for items that do not stretch such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bags</li>
<li>Aprons</li>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>Totes</li>
<li>Cushion Covers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Easyweed Stretch</strong> is recommended for anything that may stretch (generally clothing items):</p>
<ul>
<li>Socks</li>
<li>Tshirts</li>
<li>Robes</li>
<li>Onesies</li>
<li>Pants</li>
<li>Leggings</li>
</ul>
<p> Any other type of vinyl you use? let us know what you use it for. </p>

      <![CDATA[<p>We've had a request for instructions on how to clean our Mermaid Cushion covers. We figured if one person was asking a few might be wondering so here goes: </p>
<p>Since the pillows are decorative they are not meant for sleeping and might not need to be washed.</p>
<p>But if you do please remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t pull on any string, this will tear out some sequins, simply take a needle and sew the string in.</li>
<li>Stains: use spot wash with soap and warm wet cloth.</li>
<li>If stain cannot be removed hand washing in cold water with hand wash friendly detergent would be the next option.</li>
<li>Sometimes this also doesn’t work so they can (not recommended) be washed in the washing machine. Make sure to put the pillow inside out in a mesh lingerie back and wash on a gentle cold cycle. **This should only be used as a last resort method.</li>

    <title>Pricing your items… is there really a formula?</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>As a fellow crafter, I completely understand how hard it is to price items and that people generally look at items without asking how they are made, the quality or the process and they purchase the cheapest one.</p>
<p>This is why it is very important to do market research prior to setting your prices. If you are not sure how much you should be selling items for you can have a look in a few places.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafting Facebook groups</li>
</ul>
<p>These will give you an idea of what everyone everywhere is selling items for and it also helps you figure out if items are popular and what sells best during different seasons. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your Facebook marketplace or Facebook buy and sell groups</li>
</ul>
<p>These will give you an idea of who else local to you is selling items, what type of items as well as their prices. Depending on where blanks are bought there could be a degree of variation in pricing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The magical formula</li>
</ul>
<p>I have seen several formulas going around to calculate the retail cost of items. The retail side of things is generally 3x your materials with some modification </p>
<p>Ex: a mug with a one colour decal</p>
<p>Costs: Mug = 3$, Vinyl=1$ total cost =4$</p>
<p>4$ (total cost) x 3 = 12$ for a mug </p>
<p>Depending on your area some people will pay premium prices. Research is key in determining what kind of market you are selling for.</p>
<p>I have often heard of people selling for less because it’s a hobby and there is nothing wrong with that as long as items are not being sold cheaper than your competitor to simply undercut them and get more business.</p>
<p>Our crafting community spans over the entire country and it is amazing to think that we can all lift each other up and help each other out. If you know a fellow crafter will be at the same show or same event as you, there is no need to change your prices and lower them. Every crafter has a different style and taste; people will buy items that appeal to them. </p>
<p>One last thing to remember is that some crafters do this as a fulltime job, when undercutting your prices you are devaluing yourself as a crafter, other crafters and you will often simply be known as “that cheaper place to get stuff” instead of for the hard work and heart you put into every single item.</p>
<p>Have a great day everyone!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>There have been a few incidents that were brought to our attentions where someone “took” someone else’s image and used it on their business page and tried to pass it off as their own. There are actually copyright laws against doing this and we covered this topic in our other blog : Images that don’t belong to you… Is it okay to use them or not?</p>
<p>What we want to talk about today is what do you do once you find out someone has been using your picture. What are the next steps to take.</p>
<p>1- You can contact the person directly and you could send a message that says something like :</p>
<p>Hi (insert name),</p>
<p>I am the owner of (insert company name). I am writing to you because it has come to my attention that you are using one of my business photographs as marketing purposes for your business. This isn’t an acceptable practice without my permission and I would like for you to remove the image from your page please.</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>
<p>(name here)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2- If you know the images you posted were taken from a group you shared them in you can bring it to the attention of the administrator or of the group admin. We do not suggest posting the name of the person in the group as this would start unnecessary arguments and comments to be directed at that person.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>We’ve had a few post in the group come across with this topic and it got us thinking about when it’s okay to use a picture that doesn’t belong to you.</p>
<p>Our group moderator is fantastic at posting ideas and images of things she does to encourage crafters, we all share ideas and on Wednesdays there is a post created so everyone can share what they have worked on that week.</p>
<p>This post is especially fun for crafters who cannot post on their personal page or their business page because the item is a gift or a surprise.</p>
<p>We love when everyone shares their ideas but does that mean that if someone posts a picture in the group anyone can use it?</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb the answer is always NO!!! You cannot take a picture (with or without a watermark) and share it anywhere without the owner’s permission even saying it is not your picture or that you can make something LIKE the image. This is considered false advertising since you didn’t create the item in question.</p>
<p>It is safest to create your own designs and products and take picture of them to share.</p>
<p>have you had this experience? Not sure how to deal with someone taking your pictures and passing them off as your own? Checkout our blog on</p>
<p><a href="https://www.designblanks.ca/blogs/news/how-to-deal-with-someone-who-took-your-pictures">How to deal with someone who took your pictures…</a></p>
<p>*There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, you want to gauge interest with your customers before stocking a product. It is OKAY to ASK for permission from your suppliers to share the image for your customers to place their orders. It is at the suppliers discretion whether they let you use the image or not as it is their property. Read more about that here :</p>

<p>You should always protect yourself when posting pictures by including a watermark on the image or something that cannot be easily removed from the image.</p>
<p>Not sure how to do that?</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>You often see images watermarked and might wonder why this is so important in the crafting world.</p>
<p>The idea behind watermarking is that no one else will take your image and pass it off as their own.</p>
<p>This can be especially frustrating if you live in the same town/city as the person posting YOUR image claiming it is their work. It could potentially discredit you as a business to your customers.</p>
<p>In order to prevent that we will show you easy ways to watermark your images:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>From Your Phone:</strong></span></p>
<p>Depending which device you have you will have access to different types of applications. Here are some of the ones we have tried and liked. They all have the same basic functions. There are tons of other ones out there as well.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-02-13_at_2.41.08_PM_large.png?v=1518639832" alt="Add Watermark Free Application Logo" width="78" height="73">Add Watermark free</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-02-13_at_2.41.24_PM_medium.png?v=1518639836" alt="Photo Watermark free application logo" width="77" height="79">Photo Watermark</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Screen_Shot_2018-02-13_at_2.56.48_PM_large.png?v=1518639841" alt="iWatermark+ Free Add Text, Logo, Signature Caption application logo" width="80" height="79">iWatermark+ Free Add Text, Logo, Signature Caption</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On The Computer</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/download_large.png?v=1518639828" alt="Pic Monkey logo" width="95" height="95">Pic Monkey</p>
<p>This web application is very easy to use and does so much more than watermark images. You will notice our website has some images watermarked with the ‘Design Blanks’ logo. This is how we prevent others from using the images we took and edited ourselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/download-1_large.png?v=1518639824" alt="Microsoft Powerpoint logo" width="82" height="82"> Powerpoint also has the feature now to watermark your images.</p>
<p>Here is a link on how to do it: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-watermark-to-a-photo-with-powerpoint-2374ae14-b50e-4a7f-9d06-bd82206e16ec">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-watermark-to-a-photo-with-powerpoint-2374ae14-b50e-4a7f-9d06-bd82206e16ec</a></p>
<p>The watermark should not overpower your image or take away from it. It should still be very visible. This allows you to showcase your item without having anyone being easily able to steal your image.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Something to remember:</span></p>
<p>Those who know how to use editing software can remove watermarks however, this is not a skill that most people posses and including a watermark often discourages others from taking your image and using it as their own.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Save yourself wear and tear on your machine as well as your vinyl inventory through making several cuts to see which colour will look best on each item. It’s actually quite simple, The programs that I use are Silhouette studio, the Paint program that comes with the computer and a free watermark app to claim each photo as mine so they are not stolen. Please note that this process is for silhouette, PC users, I’m unfamiliar with the Cricut program, but I’m sure something similar could be done.<br><br>Step one:</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Capture_compact.PNG?v=1515550969" alt=""><br> <br>Take a photo of the blank item, simple, right?<br>I suggest setting up the photo as if you’re trying to sell it, use your backdrop or scenic background. If you’re doing a glass it will be best if you put tissue paper inside so that the lettering will show up well. Once you have taken the photo you need to transfer it to your computer, if you took the photo with your phone you can email it to yourself, if you took it with a real camera then you can upload it onto your computer. <br><br>Step two:</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Capture.PNG2_compact.PNG?v=1515551060" alt=""><br> <br>Open the photo in your Silhouette studio.<br>Once you have opened your blank item photo in Studio you can create and place your design on top of the item. You will be able to see what it looks like in different fonts, different colours, with an offset, everything that you can do in studio and how you would cut for a sample you can do digitally without wasting any materials. I always recommend measuring the actual item and comparing the design that you have made to that measurement to ensure that your mock up is as close to the real thing as possible. Please note that the colours will not be exact, you can only choose the colours that your computer has to offer unless you cut each design out of the colour swatches provided by your vinyl supplier, but that is a lot of extra work and not really necessary. As long as you explain to the customer that the photo you are sending them is just a mock up and will not be exact to the final product, but as close as possible. <br><br>Step three:</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Capture.PNG3_compact.PNG?v=1515551140" alt=""><br>Screen shot your mock up. <br>This process will vary depending on the computer you are using. I use an ACER aspire and my process is CTRL+PRTSC. The screen shot will now be able to be pasted into your paint program (Note: make sure the photo is as large as it can be on your screen or the quality will suffer). Once pasted into your paint program you can crop the unnecessary pieces out of your photo and save it to your computer.<br><br>Step four: (optional)</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1669/2063/files/Capture.PNG4_compact.PNG?v=1515551195" alt=""><br> <br>Import your photo into a watermarking app and add your watermark then resave and send or post as desired. I use Visual Watermark 4.60- Trial Version, it leaves their watermark in a small grey box in the bottom of every photo that you put through the water marker. That doesn’t bother me at all, it’s a free app, you can always either pay to upgrade to remove their watermark or leave enough empty space on the bottom of your photos so that you can cut it out in an edit feature of your photo gallery.</p>
